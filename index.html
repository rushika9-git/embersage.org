<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    EmberSage is a community-driven nonprofit initiative focused on
    supporting middle school and high school students through
    stress-relieving, wellness-based group activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    In today’s fast-paced and high-pressure environment, teens often
    struggle with stress, anxiety, and social isolation.
    EmberSage creates a welcoming space where teens can slow down,
    express themselves, move their bodies, and build meaningful
    connections—without judgment or competition.
